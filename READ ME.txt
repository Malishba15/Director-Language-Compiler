README - How to Run the Code

Steps to Run the Code
Load the .cpp file:
1. Open the provided .cpp file in a C++ development environment or compiler 

Prepare the Input File:
1. At the same location as the .cpp file, create a file named input.txt.
2. Write your input program in input.txt following the syntax and rules of the custom language, as outlined in the attached documentation.
3. Adding meaningful test cases to thoroughly validate different aspects of the compiler (e.g., declarations, loops, conditions, arithmetic operations).

Run the Compiler:
1. Execute the .cpp file in your development environment. The compilation process will begin.

Output Files:
1. During the lexical analysis phase, two files will be generated: 
output.txt: Contains the tokens identified from the input program.
symbolTable.txt: Contains a symbol table with details like identifiers, their types, sizes, and scope.
If the input program contains syntax errors, they will be logged in error.txt during the syntax analysis phase.

Syntax Analysis:
1. If the syntax is correct, the symbolTable.txt file will be updated with additional information, such as line numbers where identifiers are used.
2. If syntax errors are detected, the compilation stops, and the errors can be reviewed in error.txt.
Semantic Analysis and Execution:
3. If the syntax is correct, the semantic analysis phase is initiated. It verifies type compatibility, scope rules, and proper usage of identifiers.
4. Upon successful semantic analysis, the program executes, and the output is displayed on the screen.
